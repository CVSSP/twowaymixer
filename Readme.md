TwoWayMixer
==========

An experimental prototype for remixing musical audio on web browsers. A neural network is trained to estimate time-frequency masks for each instrument, using [Convnetjs](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/).

The data used for training the networks can be downloaded from the [SiSEC website](http://sisec.inria.fr/sisec-2015/2015-professionally-produced-music-recordings/).

An online demo can be found [here](http://cvssp.org/projects/maruss/webmaruss/).
